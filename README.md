# CM3035 - Mobile Developement - SGTravel

The application I have developed is a public transport application, named as SGTravel. This application helps to provide information regarding buses and trains in Singapore, such as bus stops, available time and bus and train number. It also provides userâ€™s current location and public transport arrival time.
